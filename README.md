I decided to delve deep into Javascript since I really enjoyed it.

I couldn't get the dropdown menu to work with the if then logic, I used https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_select.html to help me use the dropdown commands in D3.
While I was debugging I also changed the variable to const to make sure nothing was messing up.

I also found another way to filter the data that is more efficient:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48844452/filter-array-of-objects-by-array-of-ids
