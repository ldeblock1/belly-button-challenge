I couldn't get the dropdown menu to work with the if then logic, I used https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_select.html to help me use the dropdown commands in D3.
I also had trouble runn the for loops through the arrays and I did a for each loop that worked perfectly (don't know why) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-foreach-and-for-loop-in-javascript/
